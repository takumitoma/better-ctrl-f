## 🔒 Privacy & Data Handling

During the highlighting process, the extension analyzes the content of web pages accessed by users. However, this analysis is performed entirely locally within the user's browser. The extension does not store, transmit, or process any page content or user data on external servers. The only data persistently stored are user preferences, such as search queries and highlight colors, which are kept locally in the browser's storage for the purpose of maintaining user settings between sessions.
